# python-api-challenge

This repo was created to analyze what the weather is like at the equator using the citipy Python library, and the OpenWeatherMap API.

Using these resources, we are analyzing the weather around the equator, and whether there is a relationship between the weather and the latitude. 

Outputs of the analysis are stored in the "output_data" folder.
